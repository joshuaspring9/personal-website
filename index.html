					<p class="left-align white-text">Hello! My name is Joshua Zeitlinger and I&#8217;m a programmer/web developer. A college sophomore, I attend classes at <a class="orange-text" href="http://stevens.edu" target="_blank">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, a small school located directly across from Manhattan in northern New Jersey.</p>
					<p class="left-align white-text">Tech has been my passion from a very early age, whether I&#8217;m checking out the latest devices or brushing up on some programming skills for my latest project.  I started my first website in the 8th grade, where I learned my first coding skills.  Several years later, I&#8217;m now fluent in several back and front end languages.</p>
					<p class="left-align white-text">I recently finished a summer conducting independent research at the Maritime Security Center, a Deparment of Homeland Security center of excellence.  Under the guidance of Prof Breandan Englot, I explored the application of computer vision techniques to underwater sonar imagery.  Identifying subsea piplines in the imagery will allow for an underwater autonomous vehicle, the BlueROV2, to traverse and inspect these subsea pipelines without human intervention.  I also completed an internship at Grand Central Tech, where I had the opportunity to work with Source3, a 3D licensing company later aquired by Facebook.  Source 3 was founded in the fall of 2014 by former Googlers and a team of 3D printing industry vets.  As an important member of the team, I was responsible for building small web apps to interface with 3D printing APIs during my tenure.  I was later hired and built a platform for 3D content creators to license their designs with intellectual property holders.  As I progress through college, I look forward to receiving more opportunities to gain experience and aquire new skills.</p>

					<h5 class="center">Education</h5>
					<p class="light">A college sophomore, I currently attend classes at <a class="orange-text" href="https://stevens.edu" target="_blank">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, a small university on the banks of the Hudson River across from New York City.  My studies currently focus on my major, computer science.  My coursework also includes a well rounded balance of math, science, and humanities to supplement my education. I previously graduated from <a class="orange-text" href="http://regis.org" target="_blank" >Regis High School</a>, a tuition free college preparatory school on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</p>

					<h5 class="center">Experience</h5>
					<p class="light">This past summer I conducted independent computer vision research at the Maritime Security Center, a department of Homeland Security center of excellence.  I also have completed a summer internship at the Grand Central Tech coworking space, where I developed a startup company with Google, Microsoft, and General Assembly employees.  During my time there, I interned for Source3, a 3D printing startup founded by ex-Googlers. In my spare time I maintain my own weather website, <a href="http://201weather.com" class="orange-text">South Bergen Weather</a>.</p>

					<h5 class="center">Skills</h5>
					<p class="light">I am a skilled programmer, capable of coding and designing for both the front and back end of applications.  I am an expert in computer hardware and repairs.  My time at Grand Central Tech has goven me exposure to the startup environment, where my internship taught me the ins and outs of running a business.  I am also skilled at system administration.  I have successfully deployed servers powered by Postfix, Dovecot, Roundcube, Apache, Nginx, Pure-ftpd, OpenZFS, Samba, and OpenVPN.</p>
